## Branching strategy:
Since this module and its projects are individual by nature, GitHub Flow will be used as a branching strategy. This strategy provides the most streamlined approach. When changes are made they are simply merged with the Main branch.

## .gitignore and credentials
.gitignore files will be used in each project accordingly, not uploading sensitive files/information to the repos. Credentials will be provided with the submission of each project in a secure way.
